## 🛡️ Authentication Middleware

This app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
After logging in, the user will receive a JWT token, which must be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for all protected routes.

Example header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

---

## ⚙️ Error Handling

The app includes custom error handling middleware.
Errors are caught and returned with the appropriate status code and message.

Example error response:
```
{
  "message": "Error message describing the issue."
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can use Postman or Insomnia to test the API endpoints manually.
For unit testing, consider using Jest or Mocha.

Example tests:
* Verify user registration and login flow.
* Test CRUD operations for contacts.
* Test authentication with valid and invalid JWT tokens.
